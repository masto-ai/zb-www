                  <strong>Use of Cookies</strong> The Masto AI website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or

                  One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize
                  Masto AI pages, or register with Masto AI site or services, a cookie helps Masto AI to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as
                  billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Masto AI website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Masto AI features that you customized.
