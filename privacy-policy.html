                <h4>Personal Data</h4>
                <p>
                  While using Our Service, We may ask you to provide Us with certain
                  personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or
                  identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not

                <h5>Google Account Authentication</h5>
                <p>
                  The Dashboard Service allows you to log-in using OAuth authentication.
                  OAuth is a secure mechanism which authorizes the Service for one or more
                  scopes of access of your Google Account. Scopes define the specific kinds
                  of data the Service requests to access from your Google Account on behalf
                  of you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here are the scopes requested by the Service in the consent screen that
                  appears when logging in to the Dashboard Service, and their rationale:
                </p>
                <ul>

                    email address is associated to the chat bots and other resources
                    created while you use the Service.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>userinfo.profile</strong> (read-only): To display your account
                    name and image in the Service.

                    detection queries.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Identity and Access Management (IAM) API</strong> (read/write):

                    required to successfully issue intent detection queries to the
                    Dialogflow API.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such

                  means to protect your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute
                  security.
